she play the same classic music that previou candid alway play and it wouldnt feel so if her oppon hadnt start play the question for 2016 is whether american are so disgust with polit as usual that

that despit hickss denial page wa not onli still part of the trump campaign but it conduit for russian influenc wa he one way to answer the question wa to figur out how he even got on that list to begin with.on sourc suggest to me that richard burt former u.s. ambassador to germani start treati negoti and longtim lobbyist for alfa bank wa the nexu it wa burt who help draft trump foreign polici speech in april and had been advis the trump campaign via senat jeff session on foreign polici but when met burt at hi offic at the mclarti associ lobbi shop he look at me and said he had never even

burt but campaign cochair sam clovi who recruit page if he wa part of that origin group of peopl can say with 70 percent confid it wa sam clovi thi person told me.im not answer your question clovi told me he refus to tell me if he wa the one who found page but jason miller the campaign other spokesperson say carter page isnt someon ive interact with which confirm what polici staffer on the trump campaign told me carter is red her not rasputin he never met trump never brief him he ha zero influenc none.wa page the shadowi messeng between the kremlin and trump tower or wa he the nebbishi notverysuccess man tri to profit from the arbitrag between what trump saidh my adviserand what hi associ saidwho mayb wasnt do thi right and mayb everyon wa lie to me but it wa hard not to come to the conclus that regardless of whatev game the russian were run page wa firmli in the latter camp.i dont know about hi russia fund other than it never realli materi say the promin player in the energi space whom page ha pitch on variou energi project everi convers ive had with carter ha not been terribl seriou theyv all been pieintheski idea there are usual issu with traction and execut capabl he went on couldnt name project that could connect carter name to ani project that actual happened.i dont know how he earn live off thi the energi player say but think he been tri to be an intermediari if you hang around russia long enough it sort of like pinbal machin someth will hit you.strang it wa not russian pinbal that hit him it wa trump accord to the trump polici advis thi winter clovi began to draw up list of peopl who could serv as polici advis to the campaign and give it some intellectu and polici heft at time when establish republican foreign polici specialist were trip over each other to get away from trump lot of peopl came to sam clovi in februari march and said want to be part of the team say the trump advis and that how it happen he just guy on list trump look at the list and said he an advis and now he milk it for all it worth.now someon whom no one in the field had ever heard of wa suddenli veri import person in washingtonor at least could plausibl market himself as one wa not awar of him at all until he wa name to the campaign and even after that had never heard of him one russia specialist in washington told me he saw page at washington roundtabl in june for indian prime minist narendra modi and what he saw wa strang kind of person one who wa veri differenti to everyon there in way that someon who is junior would use it to network but who wa drop hint full of mean to anyon who would listenand be impress he wa say he wa plan to go to moscow the russia specialist recal he didnt say what he wa go to do there but he creat the impress that there could be some mean to the trip.accord to congression leadership staffer familiar with the intellig brief on page trip to russia the meet did happen and that been establish as fact think the investig is more what happen in them but it remain unclear the staffer told me unprompt what thi even meant it not just did he met with them or not but now look into the bigger question of what the hell is go on said the staffer is he act as conduit in way that are against america nation secur interest wittingli or un should add it what hard to pars about thi is he do thi with nefari intent or is thi just about guy who are thrill to be live in john le carr novel or are they be play by much smarter peopl in the kremlin thi seem to be vintag carter page man whose stori never quit add up as much as he tri to make the number work but he also master the art of manipul the distanc between hi stori as it is and hi stori as he want it to be play on the uncertainti in between to make himself seem more success more connect even more evil than he realli to tri to turn profit off of that if page use hi statu as trump advisor for person gain that anoth matter time for page to join twitter michael former u.s.

bomb and shell other of our purport alli exampl the kurd so democrat administr carri on the work of the bush presid without thought and without question year after year ha kept send more young men and women into the grinder.scor of democrat elect offici onc spoke and work tirelessli to end our disastr war in vietnam today there is onli the voic of the marvel democrat member of congress tulsi

militari technolog coupl with our seem complet careless in how that technolog prowess destroy peopl and nations.most amaz of all howev is that as we proclaim that the terrorist threaten europ threaten the unit state threaten western civil itselfa we face all thi we do not concentr our militari might against thi uniqu threat.wher are we send our warrior our ship our plane whi to russia which the u.s. gener who command nato ha announc is the prime existenti threat to america as you read thi ground air and naval forc of nato led and larg paid for by the unit state have been move about the western border of russia carri out the largest militari maneuv sinc world war ii at the same time our most power carrier and naval air forc have been steam about the south china sea there perhap to find encount of unknow potenti with the rise forc of china our second said to be existenti enemy.ther are no russian terrorist ravag franc or itali or america isi is not to be found on russian soil the onli russian terrorist who have attack the west are the islamist whom presid putin first ask us to join in the fight against in 1999. the onli chines terrorist are uighur who are attack not us but china itself it would seem elementari common sens that america would have long sinc sought not to fight with russia and china but to cooper with both to suppress the terrorist and the terror that have plagu us for over gener includ the isi that is terror europ today.form defens secretari william perri democrat warn that we are now today on the threshold of new cold war ... new nuclear arm race ... the likelihood of nuclear catastroph is actual greater than it wa dure the cold war.sur the war and threat of war alreadi on our horizon would be more than enough for ani empir and our empir as everi thought person know is alreadi stagger under the immeasur load of debt pile up by america by our govern our corpor our household our student and our promis of unlimit benefit in the futur the year of constant combat have exhaust our militari fals hope and vain promis of victori have burnt up the cach of ideal and patriot commit with which we began the war gener ago our forc are worn out especi the elit warrior unit that have been constantli deploy for more than decade.but omin there is more to come more that alreadi stare us in the face the dire event of thi summer have shown us the true danger that lurk here at home thi is not danger import from syria or iraq or russia our greatest menac is the danger of our own histori our inherit to the latest day.for the fact is that while we chase chimera of peac and justic in land far from our own impos ourselv and our concept on stranger who reject our teach we were neglect our own countri and our own peopl our own neighbor our own children and our own friend and now we can see the result the violenc we took to other countri bounc back to our own the money we squander on bomb in iraq wa not avail for our own school the brilliant young men and women who gave up their bodi and their live on distant battlefield were not here to teach and mentor and guid the young peopl of the ghetto they were not here to polic the mean street to suppress and elimin the crime that is the greatest caus of poverti they were not here to bring the protect and the bless of the american constitut to the least among us they were not here to protect american citi and enrich american lives.and they were not here to keep american and american children from murder american polic offic thi is our true present danger.so my hope for america is thi first we must begin immedi to end our involv in endless unnecessari and therefor murder war we need our best young peopl to help us here at home we need to stop the reckless militari spend on more destruct armament we need to breath free again.w must and will defend civil order against it deadli enemi isi and it brethren must be elimin no quarter no hesit but we will need to engag all civil peopl in our mutual defens we must abandon foolish skirmish and petti jealousi we must end our reflex effort to domin other develop nation especi russia and china.presid kennedi told us over and over that our own peac and secur in thi danger world would depend upon peac and cooper relat with russia and the russian peopl inde at the end of hi presid ronald reagan said the same fool in washington intent on world domin would have us ignor that wisdom now but it is the wisdom that we need to preserv the world and our children future.second we must at the same time begin to recov our domest peac there are mani ill to be cure mani shortcom to be righted.but noth can be accomplish in the midst of war against polic an insurrect against the constitut itself our clear prioriti is reinforc of our polic and polic depart we need mani more and better polic we need them to be better train not as warrior but as shepherd as leader and teacher of the young as peacemak in commun that have not known real peac for mani year we need our veri best young peopl not get their leg blown off by in afghanistan but save all of our live in st. loui and chicago and detroit and baton roug and all the other wast place in our own land.donald trump ha been mock mercilessli for say america first but to demand that all the action of govern at home or abroad be first direct at the interest and wellb of our own countri is not oldfashion or outmod rather it repres the deepest wisdom and tradit of american statesmen from the founder on onli with clear vision of what is truli in the interest of our nation and our fellow citizen and full commit to those interest can we act wise at home and in the world beyond.fin our presid ha told us we must lower our voic of cours we do not hope for domest discord but the peopl of the unit state have perhap stood silent for too long the elit of opinion and govern have not hesit to offer us instruct from the height of their power and emin these are the peopl who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domest disast thi presid tell us that we must now spend anoth trillion dollar on new nuclear weapon system and when we ask who will be the target for these worlddestroy weapon say onli there can be no busi as usual with russia.sur he must have misspoken for anyon can see we are on cours of mad we simpli can not fight the entir world russia and china and all the nation of the mideast and fight war at home all at the same time.and therefor we citizen must not be silent we must speak as with one great overwhelm voic voic as power as washington as jefferson as lincoln as martin luther king return to the wisdom of the founder who fought necessari war to defend the union but sought no foreign conquests.do not step over the threshold of new cold war new nuclear arm race with russia and china but seek to enlist them in common ventur to resist the forc of terror and chao that threaten all civilization.commit to our own domest peac and secur rather than persist in vain effort to control the live and affair of 200 foreign nations.thi as understand it is the platform of donald trump it wa not the republican parti platform and he had to overcom much opposit within hi parti to gain the nomin but it is hi platform it is the platform he ha restat again and again with determin and with the courag and persist to outlast hi critic it is platform that even in these troubl day could fulfil the hope of the greatest american of all parties.wel may we seek reassur whether mr. trump ha the kind of cool judgment and selfpossess that the presid requir the judgment that come to the fore in crisi that save nation or perhap world no one can ever truli know how futur presid will react to such enorm pressur but trump ha given some evid he

onli presid from my nativ state pennsylvania turn out to be my man.start with hi anem minimalist solut to one of america great financi downturns.for long time befor buchanan in effect precipit the panic of 1857 thing were go well for the countri at least in an econom sens there had been bad downturn 20 year befor with multipl caus like war in europ the dissolut of the bank of the unit state and overspecul in oddli enough slave and western land the great acquisit of land under presid jame knox polk from oregon to california to texa reinvigor the economi and boom last for the next two decad railroad were the big player sinc so mani peopl want to move west into the new territori and state manufactur boom domest and then with foreign trade as well sinc europ had quell mani of it hostil and american item were cheaper than those on the continent.then the day befor buchanan took offic congress pass what he want the tariff bill of 1857 which lower tariff on panopli of item from abroadbuchanan want to stimul foreign tradebut made american manufactur good of the same sort less competitive.thre day later came the real fatal blow though the dred scott suprem court decis which fell on the shoulder of buchanan the case had wound through state and feder court for at least decad but roger taney the suprem court chief justic and fellow alumnu with buchanan of small dickinson colleg want it settled.scott wa slave to militari man who at time wa station not in hi nativ missouri slave state but in the northwest territori which were nonslav after hi master die scott brought the case that he should be free becaus he had live in nonslav territori buchanan want to be hero and thought if the case could be decid broadli it could settl the question of slaveri in the union for good.buchanan knew too though that the court had five southern and four northern and if the decis were split that way it would be ineffect he and taney had appar agre to have narrow decis or remand the case back to the appeal court if it were mere section sinc they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decis to be legitimate.ignor the idea of separ of power though buchanan browbeat robert cooper grier anoth dickinson alumnu and justic from pennsylvania to go along with the major opinion which taney would write eventu new york nativ justic samuel nelson wrote concur opinion make the vote even less sectional.legend ha it that taney on the capitol stair just befor he gave buchanan the oath of offic at the inaugur told buchanan that the decis would becom public in

slave and thu could not bring ani suit he also wrote that the constitut gave no state or territori the power to institut or convers prohibit slaveri thu all the compromis about it go back to the 1820 were invalid and in fact the fugit slave law requir anyon who knew about it to return slave to their owner anywher in the countri wa in force.histor expert rate dred scott as the worst decis in the court histori but short of that it wa at the veri least transform for the countrywith not just taney but sure buchanan respons for it.a appal as most of the countri wa about the moral of the decis at the time there wa practic downsid too now no one knew whether he or she want to go west to use the railroad or to start busi that railroad might profit from railroad stock start to declin in valu and
